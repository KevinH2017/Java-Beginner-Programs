# Java Beginner Programs
 My Java programs based on lessons from the Udemy class "Java Tutorial for Complete Beginners" by John Purcell  
 Link: https://www.udemy.com/course/java-tutorial/


## NOTES:

Code folders must be opened in separate Visual Studio Code windows in order to run

Java filename must be the same as public class

Ignore "Resource leak: _Blank_ is never close" warnings

Open java files in separate new windows and not from the same folder in vscode to avoid missing methods errors
